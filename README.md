# NaturalFarming
Natural Farming is a chemical-free, low-cost, and eco-friendly method of agriculture that works with nature, not against it. It focuses on restoring soil life, using locally available natural inputs, and producing healthy, residue-free food while ensuring sustainable income for farmers.
